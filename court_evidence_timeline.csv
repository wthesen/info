Thank you for your response regarding the incident that occurred on December 14, 2024, at the intersection of Kincora Glen Rd NW and 37 St NW.

I understand the need to investigate all aspects of the claim. However, I must emphasize the following:

1.	Right of Way and Intersection Layout:

	*	The collision occurred at a T-intersection where their insured was required to stop at the stop sign on 37 St NW and yield to vehicles traveling eastbound on Kincora Glen Rd NW.
	*	As evidenced by the location of the damage to my vehicle (driver's side), it is clear that I was already in the intersection when their insured entered and struck my vehicle.

2.	Evidence Supporting My Claim:

	*	Attached, you will find photos of the accident scene, vehicle damage, and the layout of the intersection. These images demonstrate the following:

		*	My F-150 sustained a T-bone impact on the driver’s side, consistent with me being in the intersection first.
		*	The damage to their insured’s vehicle aligns with them striking my vehicle after failing to yield.
		*	Conflicting Dispute Rebuttal (attached)
		*	Police Report (attached)
		*	Collision Report (attached)
		*	Accident Analysis Report (attached)

3.	Their Insured’s Admission:

	*	Your insured has already admitted that they were ""blinded by the sun"" and did not see my vehicle. Sun glare is not a defense for failing to stop or yield at a stop sign, and it highlights negligence on their part.

4.	Insurance Situation:

	*	As I do not currently have insurance coverage, I am working directly with you to resolve this matter. I am providing you with all relevant information and evidence to support my claim.

Given the evidence provided, it is evident that your insured failed to stop and yield appropriately, which directly caused this collision. I respectfully request that your company accept 100% liability for this accident.

Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am also willing to provide additional context or arrange for an independent review of the scene if needed.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Wade Thesen

		Dear Waleed,

		Thank you for your response regarding the incident that occurred on December 14, 2024, at the intersection of Kincora Glen Rd NW and 37 St NW.

		I understand the need to investigate all aspects of the claim. However, I must emphasize the following:

		1.	Right of Way and Intersection Layout:

			*	The collision occurred at a T-intersection where their insured was required to stop at the stop sign on 37 St NW and yield to vehicles traveling eastbound on Kincora Glen Rd NW.
			*	As evidenced by the location of the damage to my vehicle (driver's side), it is clear that I was already in the intersection when their insured entered and struck my vehicle.

		2.	Evidence Supporting My Claim:

			*	Attached, you will find photos of the accident scene, vehicle damage, and the layout of the intersection. These images demonstrate the following:

				*	My F-150 sustained a T-bone impact on the driver’s side, consistent with me being in the intersection first.
				*	The damage to their insured’s vehicle aligns with them striking my vehicle after failing to yield.
				*	Conflicting Dispute Rebuttal (attached)
				*	Police Report (attached)
				*	Collision Report (attached)
				*	Accident Analysis Report (attached)

		3.	Their Insured’s Admission:

			*	Your insured has already admitted that they were ""blinded by the sun"" and did not see my vehicle. Sun glare is not a defense for failing to stop or yield at a stop sign, and it highlights negligence on their part.

		4.	Insurance Situation:

			*	As I do not currently have insurance coverage, I am working directly with you to resolve this matter. I am providing you with all relevant information and evidence to support my claim.

		Given the evidence provided, it is evident that your insured failed to stop and yield appropriately, which directly caused this collision. I respectfully request that your company accept 100% liability for this accident.

		Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am also willing to provide additional context or arrange for an independent review of the scene if needed.

		I look forward to your response.

Can you acknowledge TD Insurances plan to address this accident?  It has been nearly a month since the accident and the process has slowed; the driver was clearly at fault.

Issues of concern:

I have had a vehicle for nearly a month
Currently renting a vehicle for $50/day (totaling $1,300 so far)
Vehicle storage at a rate of $43/day (to date costs of $1,118)
Towing costs of approximately $200 (to confirm)
Potential sale of vehicle from the Calgary Impound lot due to inactivity
Medical expenses
Lost time work costs
TOTAL INCURRED COSTS: $2,418

Please respond immediately regarding TD Insurances plans to address these.  It has been nearly a week without any correspondence with TD Insurance and I do not want to escalate this matter.

Thank you for your email.

We did send third party report to your insurance company. I called to your insurance company Aviva and still they have not opened any claim for you.

I have informed you that you would need to open claim from your insurance company and TD will deal with your insurance company.

 

TD will not pay you out anything in this way, you have to report this accident to your insurance, and they will connect with me.

 

I just spoke with your insurance company, and they have advised that to open claim you will need to call them.

Please to avoid further delays you must report claim to your insurance company as soon as possible and then both insurance companies will deal with each other.

As mentioned in my previous email, my insurance lapsed on December 6th.  I have chatted with Aviva and they will not help with my claim.  This accident will have to be handled by TD Insurance and myself.

Hello Wade,

 

Thank you for your email.

We did send third party report to your insurance company. I called to your insurance company Aviva and still they have not opened any claim for you.

I have informed you that you would need to open claim from your insurance company and TD will deal with your insurance company.

 

TD will not pay you out anything in this way, you have to report this accident to your insurance, and they will connect with me.

 

I just spoke with your insurance company, and they have advised that to open claim you will need to call them.

Please to avoid further delays you must report claim to your insurance company as soon as possible and then both insurance companies will deal with each other.

Hello Waleed/Akara,

 

Can you acknowledge TD Insurances plan to address this accident?  It has been nearly a month since the accident and the process has slowed; the driver was clearly at fault.

 

Issues of concern:

 

I have had a vehicle for nearly a month

Currently renting a vehicle for $50/day (totaling $1,300 so far)

Vehicle storage at a rate of $43/day (to date costs of $1,118)

Towing costs of approximately $200 (to confirm)

Potential sale of vehicle from the Calgary Impound lot due to inactivity

Medical expenses

Lost time work costs

TOTAL INCURRED COSTS: $2,418

 

Please respond immediately regarding TD Insurances plans to address these.  It has been nearly a week without any correspondence with TD Insurance and I do not want to escalate this matter.

 

Regards,

Wade Thesen

		Dear Waleed,

		Thank you for your response regarding the incident that occurred on December 14, 2024, at the intersection of Kincora Glen Rd NW and 37 St NW.

		I understand the need to investigate all aspects of the claim. However, I must emphasize the following:

		1.	Right of Way and Intersection Layout:

			*	The collision occurred at a T-intersection where their insured was required to stop at the stop sign on 37 St NW and yield to vehicles traveling eastbound on Kincora Glen Rd NW.
			*	As evidenced by the location of the damage to my vehicle (driver's side), it is clear that I was already in the intersection when their insured entered and struck my vehicle.

		2.	Evidence Supporting My Claim:

			*	Attached, you will find photos of the accident scene, vehicle damage, and the layout of the intersection. These images demonstrate the following:

				*	My F-150 sustained a T-bone impact on the driver’s side, consistent with me being in the intersection first.
				*	The damage to their insured’s vehicle aligns with them striking my vehicle after failing to yield.
				*	Conflicting Dispute Rebuttal (attached)
				*	Police Report (attached)
				*	Collision Report (attached)
				*	Accident Analysis Report (attached)

		3.	Their Insured’s Admission:

			*	Your insured has already admitted that they were ""blinded by the sun"" and did not see my vehicle. Sun glare is not a defense for failing to stop or yield at a stop sign, and it highlights negligence on their part.

		4.	Insurance Situation:

			*	As I do not currently have insurance coverage, I am working directly with you to resolve this matter. I am providing you with all relevant information and evidence to support my claim.

		Given the evidence provided, it is evident that your insured failed to stop and yield appropriately, which directly caused this collision. I respectfully request that your company accept 100% liability for this accident.

		Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am also willing to provide additional context or arrange for an independent review of the scene if needed.

		I look forward to your response.

		Best regards,
		Wade Thesen

		Hello,


		Thank you for your email.

		Please reach out to your insurance and advise them to contact me directly. 

		Your insurance company would need to provide us dash cam or any other solid evidence, if possible, since our insured has mentioned that when he entered in an interaction there was no car and he did stopped at stop sign.


		Once we investigate all aspects then we will discuss either this 100% at fault collision claim or 50/50.

		We will send third party report to your insurance company as well.

		Dear Waleed,

		Thank you for your response regarding the incident that occurred on December 14, 2024, at the intersection of Kincora Glen Rd NW and 37 St NW.

		I understand the need to investigate all aspects of the claim. However, I must emphasize the following:

		1.	Right of Way and Intersection Layout:

			*	The collision occurred at a T-intersection where their insured was required to stop at the stop sign on 37 St NW and yield to vehicles traveling eastbound on Kincora Glen Rd NW.
			*	As evidenced by the location of the damage to my vehicle (driver's side), it is clear that I was already in the intersection when their insured entered and struck my vehicle.

		2.	Evidence Supporting My Claim:

			*	Attached, you will find photos of the accident scene, vehicle damage, and the layout of the intersection. These images demonstrate the following:

				*	My F-150 sustained a T-bone impact on the driver’s side, consistent with me being in the intersection first.
				*	The damage to their insured’s vehicle aligns with them striking my vehicle after failing to yield.
				*	Conflicting Dispute Rebuttal (attached)
				*	Police Report (attached)
				*	Collision Report (attached)
				*	Accident Analysis Report (attached)

		3.	Their Insured’s Admission:

			*	Your insured has already admitted that they were ""blinded by the sun"" and did not see my vehicle. Sun glare is not a defense for failing to stop or yield at a stop sign, and it highlights negligence on their part.

		4.	Insurance Situation:

			*	As I do not currently have insurance coverage, I am working directly with you to resolve this matter. I am providing you with all relevant information and evidence to support my claim.

		Given the evidence provided, it is evident that your insured failed to stop and yield appropriately, which directly caused this collision. I respectfully request that your company accept 100% liability for this accident.

		Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am also willing to provide additional context or arrange for an independent review of the scene if needed.

		I look forward to your response.

		Hello,


		Thank you for your email.

		Please reach out to your insurance and advise them to contact me directly. 

		Your insurance company would need to provide us dash cam or any other solid evidence, if possible, since our insured has mentioned that when he entered in an interaction there was no car and he did stopped at stop sign.


		Once we investigate all aspects then we will discuss either this 100% at fault collision claim or 50/50.

I am writing to follow up on my claim, as I have yet to receive any substantive responses or updates since I initially contacted you in December. I find this lack of communication concerning, especially considering that I am not at fault and the circumstances surrounding the accident are straightforward.

To ensure there is no further delay, I am requesting the following information again and expect a response within 24 hours:

1.	TD Insurance's Investigation Report confirming the insured driver is 100% at fault.
2.	Approval for rental vehicle compensation (approximately $1,600).
3.	Approval to submit lost wages (approximately $10,000).
4.	Inspection and Repair Estimate for my vehicle.
5.	Actual Cash Value (ACV) of my 2013 Ford F-150.

If I do not receive a timely response with the requested information, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further, including the possibility of legal action to recover the compensation I am entitled to.

I can be reached at 403-460-7077 or via email at wade.thesen@yahoo.com. I look forward to your prompt response.

Thank you for your response.

I understand the concern regarding the status of my insurance policy at the time of the accident. However, I would like to remind you that the accident was caused by the insured driver running a stop sign, and I was not at fault in this incident. The police report clearly reflects this and indicates that the other driver was cited for an unsafe turn.

As I was the innocent party in this accident and the other driver was found to be at fault, I believe I am entitled to full compensation for my damaged vehicle, lost wages, and rental expenses under the principle of third-party liability.

While I recognize that my own insurance coverage may have lapsed, the third-party driver’s insurance should be responsible for covering my damages. Therefore, I respectfully request that you continue to process this claim and provide the following information:

1.	Confirmation of the third-party insurance responsibility, including a clear explanation of how the lapse in my personal coverage affects my claim.
2.	Confirmation of compensation for rental vehicle costs (approximately $1,600) and lost wages (approximately $10,000), as I was not at fault.
3.	Estimate and approval of repairs to my vehicle, including the ACV of my 2013 Ford F-150.

I understand that you’ve escalated this matter to management, and I appreciate your efforts to seek further guidance. However, I would kindly request a timely response from you or your management team within 48 hours to resolve this matter and prevent unnecessary delays. If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will be forced to explore other options, including legal action, to pursue the compensation I am owed.

I can be reached at 403-460-7077 or wade.thesen@yahoo.com for further clarification. I look forward to your prompt reply.

Best regards,


Wade Thesen

		Dear Waleed,

		Thank you for your response regarding the incident that occurred on December 14, 2024, at the intersection of Kincora Glen Rd NW and 37 St NW.

		I understand the need to investigate all aspects of the claim. However, I must emphasize the following:

		1.	Right of Way and Intersection Layout:

			*	The collision occurred at a T-intersection where their insured was required to stop at the stop sign on 37 St NW and yield to vehicles traveling eastbound on Kincora Glen Rd NW.
			*	As evidenced by the location of the damage to my vehicle (driver's side), it is clear that I was already in the intersection when their insured entered and struck my vehicle.

		2.	Evidence Supporting My Claim:

			*	Attached, you will find photos of the accident scene, vehicle damage, and the layout of the intersection. These images demonstrate the following:

				*	My F-150 sustained a T-bone impact on the driver’s side, consistent with me being in the intersection first.
				*	The damage to their insured’s vehicle aligns with them striking my vehicle after failing to yield.
				*	Conflicting Dispute Rebuttal (attached)
				*	Police Report (attached)
				*	Collision Report (attached)
				*	Accident Analysis Report (attached)

		3.	Their Insured’s Admission:

			*	Your insured has already admitted that they were ""blinded by the sun"" and did not see my vehicle. Sun glare is not a defense for failing to stop or yield at a stop sign, and it highlights negligence on their part.

		4.	Insurance Situation:

			*	As I do not currently have insurance coverage, I am working directly with you to resolve this matter. I am providing you with all relevant information and evidence to support my claim.

		Given the evidence provided, it is evident that your insured failed to stop and yield appropriately, which directly caused this collision. I respectfully request that your company accept 100% liability for this accident.

		Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am also willing to provide additional context or arrange for an independent review of the scene if needed.

		I look forward to your response.

		Best regards,
		Wade Thesen

		Hello,


		Thank you for your email.

		Please reach out to your insurance and advise them to contact me directly. 

		Your insurance company would need to provide us dash cam or any other solid evidence, if possible, since our insured has mentioned that when he entered in an interaction there was no car and he did stopped at stop sign.


		Once we investigate all aspects then we will discuss either this 100% at fault collision claim or 50/50.

		We will send third party report to your insurance company as well.

Dear Waleed,

Thank you for your response.

I understand the concern regarding the status of my insurance policy at the time of the accident. However, I would like to remind you that the accident was caused by the insured driver running a stop sign, and I was not at fault in this incident. The police report clearly reflects this and indicates that the other driver was cited for an unsafe turn.

As I was the innocent party in this accident and the other driver was found to be at fault, I believe I am entitled to full compensation for my damaged vehicle, lost wages, and rental expenses under the principle of third-party liability.

While I recognize that my own insurance coverage may have lapsed, the third-party driver’s insurance should be responsible for covering my damages. Therefore, I respectfully request that you continue to process this claim and provide the following information:

1.	Confirmation of the third-party insurance responsibility, including a clear explanation of how the lapse in my personal coverage affects my claim.
2.	Confirmation of compensation for rental vehicle costs (approximately $1,600) and lost wages (approximately $10,000), as I was not at fault.
3.	Estimate and approval of repairs to my vehicle, including the ACV of my 2013 Ford F-150.

I understand that you’ve escalated this matter to management, and I appreciate your efforts to seek further guidance. However, I would kindly request a timely response from you or your management team within 48 hours to resolve this matter and prevent unnecessary delays. If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will be forced to explore other options, including legal action, to pursue the compensation I am owed.

I can be reached at 403-460-7077 or wade.thesen@yahoo.com for further clarification. I look forward to your prompt reply.

Best regards,


Wade Thesen

Dear Waleed,

I am writing to follow up on my claim, as I have yet to receive any substantive responses or updates since I initially contacted you in December. I find this lack of communication concerning, especially considering that I am not at fault and the circumstances surrounding the accident are straightforward.

To ensure there is no further delay, I am requesting the following information again and expect a response within 24 hours:

1.	TD Insurance's Investigation Report confirming the insured driver is 100% at fault.
2.	Approval for rental vehicle compensation (approximately $1,600).
3.	Approval to submit lost wages (approximately $10,000).
4.	Inspection and Repair Estimate for my vehicle.
5.	Actual Cash Value (ACV) of my 2013 Ford F-150.

If I do not receive a timely response with the requested information, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further, including the possibility of legal action to recover the compensation I am entitled to.

I can be reached at 403-460-7077 or via email at wade.thesen@yahoo.com. I look forward to your prompt response.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

	Hi Sagor,


	I spoke with the impound people and they said that you’re free to grab the vehicle from the impound lot.  They did not require any signed documentation.


	I hope that works for you

	Have included a signed copy of the registration and I’m just waiting on the invoice for the rental.

The amount on your release form does not reflect the rental amounts which are over $2,000.  I sent you the contact and agreement with Enterprise Rentals.  There was a claim with Enterprise Rentals but now they won’t accept my rental amounts.

The release form does not include loss time work or any injury amounts either.

Please advise how TD Insurance would like to proceed.  If closure of this matter does not occur soon I will have to escalate.

Feel free to call or email me.

Despite numerous emails and follow-ups over the past several months, I still have not received a complete and fair resolution to my claim (#041518966). I am now formally demanding that this matter be resolved in full within the next 7 days.

 

The release form related to the truck will not be signed until the following issues are resolved:

*	Unpaid rental costs of $4,250 (as of April 16, 2025), ongoing since January 12
*	Lost wages of approximately $10,000
*	Injury-related compensation, which has yet to be addressed at all

Your refusal to deal with these matters in good faith — while expecting a release form to be signed — is unacceptable.

 

If I do not receive a full settlement offer by April 30, 2025, I will proceed with the following:

*	File a complaint with the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO)
*	Begin legal action in Alberta Small Claims Court

 

All future communication will be retained as evidence of your handling of this file.

This is your final opportunity to resolve this without escalation.

 

Sincerely,

Hello Wade,

As per my voice mails, the final release of the truck is needed for payment and is related to the truck only.

The injuries and lost wages are separate and are handled by the injury adjuster  Sid Rafizada.

The last rental date was set for February 10th and no rental will be paid past that date.

Tom/Mohammed,

 

Given the ongoing lack of resolution and communication regarding Claim #041518966, I am now preparing to pursue legal action through civil or small claims court.

 

Please provide the contact information for TD Insurance’s legal department or legal representative handling this file, so that any further correspondence can be directed appropriately.

 

If this matter can still be resolved without litigation, I remain open to a prompt and fair settlement. However, the delays have left me no choice but to move forward with formal action.

Claim #041518966 - Release Form and Immediate Action Required

 

Dear Tom,

 

Thank you for your email. However, I must once again reiterate that I will not be signing the release form until all matters related to my claim are fully resolved. This includes compensation for lost wages, injury cap compensation, and reimbursement for the rental vehicle costs I have incurred.

 

Rental Costs:

Since January 12, 2025, I have been incurring rental vehicle expenses at a rate of $50 per day. As of today, the total rental cost has reached $4,250, and these costs are continuing to accumulate. I expect full reimbursement for the rental vehicle until all aspects of this claim are settled.

 

Lost Wages:

I have repeatedly requested compensation for my lost wages due to the injuries sustained in the accident. As of now, the total amount owed for lost wages is approximately $10,000, and this matter has yet to be addressed.

 

Injury Compensation:

Furthermore, the Alberta injury cap and other injury-related components of my claim have not been resolved, and I have made it clear on several occasions that I expect these matters to be concluded before any release form is signed.

 

I have consistently asked for resolution of these issues since December 2024, and the delays in addressing these concerns are becoming increasingly frustrating. To date, no satisfactory response has been provided. I have attached the full email chain below for your reference, highlighting my continued attempts to resolve these outstanding issues.

 

If these matters are not resolved within the next 7 days, I will be forced to escalate the situation further, including seeking legal counsel and pursuing interest payments on the rental and wage compensation as a result of the prolonged delays.

 

Please understand the urgency of this situation. I will not sign the release form until all aspects of my claim are fully settled to my satisfaction.

 

Best regards,

Escalation of Unresolved Claim – #041518966 – Urgent Attention Required.msg,<wade.thesen@yahoo.com>,<td.scco@td.com>,,Escalation of Unresolved Claim – #041518966 – Urgent Attention Required,2025-04-23 14:38:10.606520-06:00,"Dear Senior Customer Complaints Officer,

 

I am writing to formally escalate a long-standing and unresolved insurance claim with TD Insurance – Claim #041518966 – regarding an automobile incident from December 2024 involving my totaled vehicle (valued at approximately $18,000) and associated personal injury.

 

Despite numerous attempts to resolve this matter through the assigned adjusters (Tom Hanlon and Mohammed Sagor), my concerns remain unresolved, and I have not received a response to multiple written communications and follow-up emails. Most critically:

 

*	I have repeatedly requested contact from the injury adjuster Sid Rafizada, but have yet to receive any outreach.
*	My vehicle rental costs since January 12, 2025 (totaling $5,310.79 including accrued interest) have not been reimbursed.
*	My request for lost wages compensation (currently estimated at $10,000) remains unanswered.
*	The total loss settlement for my truck has not been finalized, despite my ongoing cooperation and provision of required documentation.

 

I have tried in good faith to settle all outstanding matters, including submitting full documentation and a detailed cost breakdown, but I have reached a point where escalation is necessary. If no satisfactory resolution is offered within 7 business days, I will proceed with:

 

1.	Filing a formal complaint with the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO)
2.	Initiating civil proceedings through Alberta Small Claims Court
3.	Seeking interest reimbursement for prolonged delays and non-responsiveness

 

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and advise on the next steps toward a resolution. I remain open to a fair and timely settlement.

 

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

 

Sincerely,

Formal Complaint – Claim #041518966 – Security National Insurance Company (TD Insurance).msg,<wade.thesen@yahoo.com>,<info@giocanada.org>,"<Tom.Hanlon@tdinsurance.com;>;	""'Sagor; Mohammed'"" <Mohammed.Sagor@tdinsurance.com>",Formal Complaint – Claim #041518966 – Security National Insurance Company (TD Insurance),2025-04-24 07:43:57.934853-06:00,"Dear General Insurance OmbudService (GIO),

 

I am submitting a formal complaint regarding the handling of my third-party auto insurance claim by Security National Insurance Company, a division of TD Insurance. This relates to Claim #041518966, stemming from a collision in which the insured driver under this policy was at fault.

 

Despite repeated efforts to communicate with the adjusters assigned to my case — Tom Hanlon and Mohammed Sagor — I have faced delays, incomplete responses, and insufficient compensation for losses incurred.

 

Third-Party Claim Clarification:

 

While my own insurance policy expired days prior to the collision, I am making this claim under the at-fault party’s insurance (TD Insurance). Therefore, my expired policy has no bearing on TD's legal and contractual obligation to address and settle my losses as a third-party claimant.

 

Summary of Issues:

 

1. Vehicle Value (Truck) – $18,000:

TD has acknowledged responsibility for property damage, but the vehicle valuation has been insufficient and final settlement remains unresolved. Market comparables and vehicle condition support a value closer to $18,000.

 

2. Rental Costs – $5,050.00 + $260.79 Interest:

I was forced to rent a vehicle beginning January 12, 2025, at $50/day. TD has refused to cover rental costs beyond February 10th, despite continued need due to the delay in settling my claim. I’ve incurred $5,310.79 in total (rental + accrued interest).

 

3. Lost Wages – $10,000:

Due to injuries sustained, I have been unable to work and have submitted proof of income loss. No action has been taken by TD, nor have I been contacted regarding this portion of my claim.

 

4. Injury Compensation:

Despite multiple voicemail and email requests over several months, I have received no contact from the injury adjuster, Sid Rafizada. TD continues to separate this portion from the rest of the claim and refuses to coordinate, creating significant barriers to resolution.

 

Response to Email from TD Insurance:

On April 24, 2025, I received an email from Tom Hanlon stating that TD will only be settling the property damage portion of the claim and refusing to acknowledge other compensable expenses. The message also states:

 

“We will not be covering any rental cost past the last day of Feb 10th.”

“As for any legal action. Please govern yourself accordingly.”

 

This position is unacceptable, especially given the delays and lack of coordination that TD has contributed to directly.

RE_ Your email dated April 23_ 2025 .msg,<wade.thesen@yahoo.com>,"""'Account; TD SCCO'"" <TD.SCCO@td.com>",,"RE: Your email dated April 23, 2025 ",2025-04-24 14:03:51.372033-06:00,"Dear TD Insurance Team,

 

Following up on my previous communications regarding Claim #041518966, I would first like to thank your team for facilitating contact from the personal injury department, which I had been requesting for several months. I appreciate this step forward and hope it signals improved communication going forward.

 

That said, I am writing now to formally request immediate resolution of the outstanding rental reimbursement portion of my claim, which remains unresolved.

Although the personal injury adjuster has contacted me, I was informed that their department does not handle property-related matters, including:

 

Rental vehicle costs from January 12 to February 10, 2025 ($5,150.00)

 

Accrued interest due to delay in reimbursement ($260.79)

 

Final property damage settlement for my totaled vehicle

 

This continues to be a third-party claim under your insured’s liability coverage. I am entitled to reimbursement for these direct losses caused by the at-fault driver. To date, I have not received adequate communication or resolution on these matters from your Property Damage team, despite repeated contact with Mr. Tom Hanlon and Mr. Mohammed Sagor.

 

Immediate Request:

I respectfully request the following:

That TD Insurance reimburse the total rental and interest amount of $5,410.79, or

 

That you provide a formal written explanation for denial, including policy references and justification for the February 10th cutoff date — especially considering that my vehicle claim remained open at that time.

 

Additionally, I would prefer that any further communication or action on this file be handled by another representative. My interactions with Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Sagor have consistently resulted in confusion, delay, or non-response.

 

Please consider this message a final attempt to resolve the rental portion of my claim amicably. If unresolved within 5 business days, I will proceed with filing a complaint with the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO) and begin legal proceedings via Alberta Small Claims Court.

 

Sincerely,

Thank you for contacting us regarding your concerns.

Our Office will investigate complaints and act as a liaison between customers and all business areas within TD, including: TD Canada Trust, TD Auto Finance Canada, TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance.

Thank you for your response.

 

I must once again reiterate that despite my numerous requests over the past several months, I have not received any direct contact from anyone in the injury claims department regarding the outstanding injury and lost wage portion of my claim. It is not my responsibility to locate and follow up with the relevant personnel in such a large corporation like TD Insurance. As you are aware, my usual experience with TD adjusters has been that replies often take at least 1.5 weeks, leaving me in a prolonged state of uncertainty and financial hardship.

 

Outstanding Rental Reimbursement

As previously stated, I have incurred rental vehicle expenses since January 12, 2025, due to TD's delays in fully resolving the property damage portion of my claim. These costs are a direct result of TD’s failure to act in a timely manner.

 

For your reference, the total rental cost from January 12 to April 28, 2025 (107 days) is calculated as follows:

 

 

Description    Rate     Days    Total (CAD)

Rental Vehicle (Jan 12 – Apr 28)      $50/day            107       $5,350.00

Total Owed: $5,350.00 (Rental only — interest not yet included)

 

Release Form Reiteration

I will not sign any release until all outstanding issues — including rental reimbursement, lost wages, and injury compensation — are fully addressed. Your repeated requests for a signed release while refusing to resolve these open matters are unreasonable and have only added to the frustration I’ve experienced over the course of this claim.

 

Escalation Plans

Given the continued lack of communication and resolution, I will be forced to proceed with the following steps if I do not receive a full settlement offer by April 30, 2025:

 

File a formal complaint with the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO)

 

Submit a complaint to the Alberta Superintendent of Insurance

 

Initiate legal action through Alberta Small Claims Court

 

Seek interest and cost recovery due to the delays and hardship caused

 

Please understand that this is my final request for an amicable resolution before I pursue all available avenues for redress.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Wade,

Thank you for your email.

This email serves to reiterate our position regarding the rental vehicle and your claim.

Please be advised that we will not be covering any rental days beyond February 28, 2025, nor will we be paying any interest on this rental.

As previously communicated, on January 23, 2025, Mohammed informed you via phone and a follow-up email that the settlement for the vehicle damage was being processed. He also advised that any requests for loss of wages or injuries would need to be addressed with our bodily injury team. The settlement amount for the vehicle damage, including tax, of $18,619.28 was also provided to you on January 23, 2025.

To facilitate payment of the vehicle damage settlement, we requested a copy of the signed final release on February 10, 2025, and again on February 20, 2025, via email.

During a phone call on February 28, 2025, it was reiterated that February 10, 2025, was the final day the rental would be covered and that any claims for bodily injury or lost wages needed to be directed to our bodily injury team partners.

We followed up on the signed final release via email on March 12, 2025, and again on March 18, 2025.

We have consistently advised that we are only handling the claim for the damage to the vehicle and will not be settling any injury claims or loss of wages. While we understand you did not have insurance at the time of the accident, and we are managing the vehicle damage claim directly, we have clearly communicated on multiple occasions that the rental beyond February 10, 2025, would not be covered by us and that any other costs need to be addressed with Sid. 

Once we receive the signed final release for the vehicle damage, we will initiate the payment process for the $18,619.28 settlement of the vehicle. Please also submit the rental invoices for possible reimbursement.

Regarding your recent emails mentioning potential legal action, we will always advise you to Govern Yourself Accordingly.

 

Thank you

Dear TD Insurance,

 

Following my previous correspondence and the recent reply from the Senior Customer Complaints Office (SCCO) dated April 25, 2025, I am now formally requesting that TD Insurance provide a written response from a Senior Manager regarding the unresolved property damage portion of my claim (#041518966).

 

Per SCCO’s process, no further review can take place until this is completed by your team.

 

Specific Request: Reimbursement of Rental Costs

 

I am seeking reimbursement for vehicle rental expenses incurred between January 12 and April 24, 2025 — a total of 103 days at $50/day, amounting to $5,150.00, plus $260.79 in accrued interest:

 

Description

Amount (CAD)

Rental Vehicle (103 days @ $50)

$5,150.00

Accrued Interest

$260.79

Total

$5,410.79

 

Next Steps

I am requesting a formal written response from a Senior Manager clarifying:

 

Whether TD Insurance will reimburse this amount; and

 

If not, a detailed rationale and policy reference explaining the refusal.

 

Additionally, I respectfully request that any further discussion not involve Mr. Tom Hanlon or Mr. Mohammed Sagor, as prior efforts with them have not resulted in resolution.

 

If I do not receive a written response within 5 business days, I will proceed with escalation to the Alberta Small Claims Court.

 

Thank you,

Wade Thesen

Thank you for your recent response.

 

While I acknowledge your stated position regarding a February 28, 2025 rental reimbursement cutoff, I am submitting a final good-faith proposal based on TD Insurance’s delays, fragmented communication, and unmet conditions for settlement.

 

My Position:

As a third-party claimant, I am entitled to reasonable compensation for losses incurred as a direct result of your insured’s actions. TD’s argument that reimbursement beyond February 28 is not owed because I declined to sign the property damage release overlooks a critical fact:

 

My conditions for signing were never met.

 

At the time of your request for a signed release, the following issues remained outstanding:

 

No settlement funds had been paid;

 

The claim for injury and wage loss remained unresolved;

 

No contact had been established with the injury department despite my repeated requests since December;

 

Average response time from assigned adjusters was 1.5 weeks or more, making it unreasonable to expect quick resolution.

 

In fact, substantive engagement from TD Insurance did not begin until Tom Hanlon assumed control of the file on March 31, 2025 — nearly two months after the rental cutoff date you claim is final.

 

Final Good-Faith Proposal:

I am prepared to sign the property damage release if TD Insurance agrees to reimburse the following:

 

Rental Period: January 12 – March 31, 2025 (80 days)

 

Rate: $50/day

 

Total Reimbursement Requested: $4,000.00

 

(Note: I am waiving any claim to accrued interest in the interest of prompt resolution.)

 

This offer is made in good faith. If TD continues to reject reasonable reimbursement despite clear documentation of communication delays and failure to coordinate on bodily injury claims, I will have no choice but to pursue this matter through the Alberta Small Claims Court.

 

Please also note that if legal action is pursued, both parties will incur legal fees and court-related costs, which can be avoided by resolving this matter now.

 

I respectfully request a written response within 5 business days indicating whether TD Insurance accepts this final proposal. I will submit the rental invoice covering this period upon confirmation.

 

Sincerely,

Wade Thesen

Hi Wade, 

 

Thank you for your email, 

 

As stated, we will not pay for any additional rental cost while we wait for you to sign a final release. We have also advised you that signing the final release is only for the property damage, this has nothing to do with injuries or lost wages.  We have provided you our position, any cost incurred after our last day that was set will be at your cost. We will also not cover any interest. 

 

Therefore, once receive the signed final release we will issue the money for the rental cost and valuation with the rental ending date of  February 28,2025.  You can take all the time you want to sign our final release, but the rental cost that will be incurred will be at your own cost. 

 

We will also need a copy of the rental invoice so that we can pay up to February 28,2025. 

 

As per any comment on initiating a legal action. please govern yourself accordingly. 

 

Thank you.

Dear Sandy,

 

Thank you for your response.

 

I must once again reiterate that despite my numerous requests over the past several months, I have not received any direct contact from anyone in the injury claims department regarding the outstanding injury and lost wage portion of my claim. It is not my responsibility to locate and follow up with the relevant personnel in such a large corporation like TD Insurance. As you are aware, my usual experience with TD adjusters has been that replies often take at least 1.5 weeks, leaving me in a prolonged state of uncertainty and financial hardship.

 

Outstanding Rental Reimbursement

As previously stated, I have incurred rental vehicle expenses since January 12, 2025, due to TD's delays in fully resolving the property damage portion of my claim. These costs are a direct result of TD’s failure to act in a timely manner.

 

For your reference, the total rental cost from January 12 to April 28, 2025 (107 days) is calculated as follows:

 

 

Description    Rate     Days    Total (CAD)

Rental Vehicle (Jan 12 – Apr 28)      $50/day            107       $5,350.00

Total Owed: $5,350.00 (Rental only — interest not yet included)

 

Release Form Reiteration

I will not sign any release until all outstanding issues — including rental reimbursement, lost wages, and injury compensation — are fully addressed. Your repeated requests for a signed release while refusing to resolve these open matters are unreasonable and have only added to the frustration I’ve experienced over the course of this claim.

 

Escalation Plans

Given the continued lack of communication and resolution, I will be forced to proceed with the following steps if I do not receive a full settlement offer by April 30, 2025:

 

File a formal complaint with the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO)

 

Submit a complaint to the Alberta Superintendent of Insurance

 

Initiate legal action through Alberta Small Claims Court

 

Seek interest and cost recovery due to the delays and hardship caused

 

Please understand that this is my final request for an amicable resolution before I pursue all available avenues for redress.

 

Sincerely,

Wade Thesen

Hi Wade,

Thank you for your email.

This email serves to reiterate our position regarding the rental vehicle and your claim.

Please be advised that we will not be covering any rental days beyond February 28, 2025, nor will we be paying any interest on this rental.

As previously communicated, on January 23, 2025, Mohammed informed you via phone and a follow-up email that the settlement for the vehicle damage was being processed. He also advised that any requests for loss of wages or injuries would need to be addressed with our bodily injury team. The settlement amount for the vehicle damage, including tax, of $18,619.28 was also provided to you on January 23, 2025.

To facilitate payment of the vehicle damage settlement, we requested a copy of the signed final release on February 10, 2025, and again on February 20, 2025, via email.

During a phone call on February 28, 2025, it was reiterated that February 10, 2025, was the final day the rental would be covered and that any claims for bodily injury or lost wages needed to be directed to our bodily injury team partners.

We followed up on the signed final release via email on March 12, 2025, and again on March 18, 2025.

We have consistently advised that we are only handling the claim for the damage to the vehicle and will not be settling any injury claims or loss of wages. While we understand you did not have insurance at the time of the accident, and we are managing the vehicle damage claim directly, we have clearly communicated on multiple occasions that the rental beyond February 10, 2025, would not be covered by us and that any other costs need to be addressed with Sid. 

Once we receive the signed final release for the vehicle damage, we will initiate the payment process for the $18,619.28 settlement of the vehicle. Please also submit the rental invoices for possible reimbursement.

Regarding your recent emails mentioning potential legal action, we will always advise you to Govern Yourself Accordingly.

 

Thank you

Thank you for your continued correspondence. I would like to offer a final good-faith proposal based on the documented history of this claim and your team's handling of the file.

 

Background:

Since early January 2025, I have made repeated, documented efforts to resolve this matter — both in terms of the vehicle valuation and the rental reimbursement, as well as my ongoing requests to speak with someone from TD’s personal injury team.

 

Below is a short, factual timeline outlining the efforts I’ve made and the inconsistent, delayed responses I received in return:

 

Jan 24 – Sent signed registration to Mohammed.

 

Feb 10 – Received release form ($18,619.28), no mention of rental or injury department.

 

Feb 13 – Emailed asking if I should include rental in the release. No response.

 

Feb 18 – Sent Enterprise contact info to assist your verification. No response.

 

Feb 20 – Received a revised release with rental capped at ~$404. No explanation.

 

Feb 28 – Sent registration again and submitted rental invoice ($2,197.77) for Jan 11–Feb 22.

 

Mar 12 – New release received: $20,237, implying $1,618 rental payment — a reduced figure.

 

Mar 18 – Received a follow-up with no adjustments or new information.

 

Mar 31 – Finally received contact from Tom Hanlon, marking the first meaningful progress.

 

Good-Faith Proposal:

I have continued to incur rental expenses because your team failed to reasonably address or resolve the core elements of this claim — despite consistent follow-up from my side. This includes:

 

No actionable contact from the personal injury team;

 

No accurate rental reimbursement proposals;

 

Repeated delays and unanswered questions.

 

Given these facts, I am proposing that TD Insurance reimburse my rental costs through March 31, 2025, as a reasonable and fair resolution. This date represents a turning point when meaningful engagement finally began.

 

Legal Consideration:

Should we proceed to Small Claims Court, I will present the full email chain, call logs, and invoice documentation to show:

 

That I acted in good faith at every step,

 

That TD’s delays were unreasonable and unjustified,

 

And that your current rental cut-off is arbitrary and based on incomplete or inaccurate assumptions.

 

This letter represents my final good-faith effort to resolve this without further escalation. Please respond within 5 business days. If no resolution is reached, I will proceed with both a formal complaint to the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO) and legal action via Alberta Small Claims Court.

 

Sincerely,

Wade Thesen

Hi Wade,

Just to reiterate our previous discussion, the agreed-upon last date for the rental vehicle was initially February 10, 2025, and I subsequently extended it to February 28, 2025.

While I appreciate your offer, I must confirm that February 28, 2025, will be the final day for which we can provide rental reimbursement. If you could please provide me with copies of the rental invoices you have incurred, I will ensure reimbursement up to and including February 28, 2025.

To clarify the process, similar to how your own vehicle insurance would of handle rental costs and vehicle valuation under Direct Compensation Property Damage (DCPD) if you had insurance at the time of the loss our handling of the property damage aspect of this claim, including the rental, is separate from any potential injury claim you may have. Your injury claim is being handled by our BI partners. Therefore, the rental period is not contingent on the settlement of your injury claim. As mentioned, the final rental date was originally set for February 10, 2025, and I have already extended it to February 28, 2025. I won't be able to extend it any further.

Regarding any claims for lost wages or injuries, please direct your inquiries to Sid Rafizada at 1-877-855-3767 ext. 244268 or his manager, Haala Quinlan, at 1-877-855-3767 ext. 230015. Please remember that the settlement of these potential claims is separate from the final release concerning the vehicle valuation and the agreed-upon rental period.

Thank you.

Dear Sandy and Tom,

 

Thank you for your recent response.

 

While I acknowledge your stated position regarding a February 28, 2025 rental reimbursement cutoff, I am submitting a final good-faith proposal based on TD Insurance’s delays, fragmented communication, and unmet conditions for settlement.

 

My Position:

As a third-party claimant, I am entitled to reasonable compensation for losses incurred as a direct result of your insured’s actions. TD’s argument that reimbursement beyond February 28 is not owed because I declined to sign the property damage release overlooks a critical fact:

 

My conditions for signing were never met.

 

At the time of your request for a signed release, the following issues remained outstanding:

 

No settlement funds had been paid;

 

The claim for injury and wage loss remained unresolved;

 

No contact had been established with the injury department despite my repeated requests since December;

 

Average response time from assigned adjusters was 1.5 weeks or more, making it unreasonable to expect quick resolution.

 

In fact, substantive engagement from TD Insurance did not begin until Tom Hanlon assumed control of the file on March 31, 2025 — nearly two months after the rental cutoff date you claim is final.

 

Final Good-Faith Proposal:

I am prepared to sign the property damage release if TD Insurance agrees to reimburse the following:

 

Rental Period: January 12 – March 31, 2025 (80 days)

 

Rate: $50/day

 

Total Reimbursement Requested: $4,000.00

 

(Note: I am waiving any claim to accrued interest in the interest of prompt resolution.)

 

This offer is made in good faith. If TD continues to reject reasonable reimbursement despite clear documentation of communication delays and failure to coordinate on bodily injury claims, I will have no choice but to pursue this matter through the Alberta Small Claims Court.

 

Please also note that if legal action is pursued, both parties will incur legal fees and court-related costs, which can be avoided by resolving this matter now.

 

I respectfully request a written response within 5 business days indicating whether TD Insurance accepts this final proposal. I will submit the rental invoice covering this period upon confirmation.

 

Sincerely,

Wade Thesen

Hi Wade, 

 

Thank you for your email, 

 

As stated, we will not pay for any additional rental cost while we wait for you to sign a final release. We have also advised you that signing the final release is only for the property damage, this has nothing to do with injuries or lost wages.  We have provided you our position, any cost incurred after our last day that was set will be at your cost. We will also not cover any interest. 

 

Therefore, once receive the signed final release we will issue the money for the rental cost and valuation with the rental ending date of  February 28,2025.  You can take all the time you want to sign our final release, but the rental cost that will be incurred will be at your own cost. 

 

We will also need a copy of the rental invoice so that we can pay up to February 28,2025. 

 

As per any comment on initiating a legal action. please govern yourself accordingly. 

 

Thank you.

Dear Sandy,

 

Thank you for your response.

 

I must once again reiterate that despite my numerous requests over the past several months, I have not received any direct contact from anyone in the injury claims department regarding the outstanding injury and lost wage portion of my claim. It is not my responsibility to locate and follow up with the relevant personnel in such a large corporation like TD Insurance. As you are aware, my usual experience with TD adjusters has been that replies often take at least 1.5 weeks, leaving me in a prolonged state of uncertainty and financial hardship.

 

Outstanding Rental Reimbursement

As previously stated, I have incurred rental vehicle expenses since January 12, 2025, due to TD's delays in fully resolving the property damage portion of my claim. These costs are a direct result of TD’s failure to act in a timely manner.

 

For your reference, the total rental cost from January 12 to April 28, 2025 (107 days) is calculated as follows:

 

 

Description    Rate     Days    Total (CAD)

Rental Vehicle (Jan 12 – Apr 28)      $50/day            107       $5,350.00

Total Owed: $5,350.00 (Rental only — interest not yet included)

 

Release Form Reiteration

I will not sign any release until all outstanding issues — including rental reimbursement, lost wages, and injury compensation — are fully addressed. Your repeated requests for a signed release while refusing to resolve these open matters are unreasonable and have only added to the frustration I’ve experienced over the course of this claim.

 

Escalation Plans

Given the continued lack of communication and resolution, I will be forced to proceed with the following steps if I do not receive a full settlement offer by April 30, 2025:

 

File a formal complaint with the General Insurance OmbudService (GIO)

 

Submit a complaint to the Alberta Superintendent of Insurance

 

Initiate legal action through Alberta Small Claims Court

 

Seek interest and cost recovery due to the delays and hardship caused

 

Please understand that this is my final request for an amicable resolution before I pursue all available avenues for redress.

 

Sincerely,

Wade Thesen

Hi Wade,

Thank you for your email.

This email serves to reiterate our position regarding the rental vehicle and your claim.

Please be advised that we will not be covering any rental days beyond February 28, 2025, nor will we be paying any interest on this rental.

As previously communicated, on January 23, 2025, Mohammed informed you via phone and a follow-up email that the settlement for the vehicle damage was being processed. He also advised that any requests for loss of wages or injuries would need to be addressed with our bodily injury team. The settlement amount for the vehicle damage, including tax, of $18,619.28 was also provided to you on January 23, 2025.

To facilitate payment of the vehicle damage settlement, we requested a copy of the signed final release on February 10, 2025, and again on February 20, 2025, via email.

During a phone call on February 28, 2025, it was reiterated that February 10, 2025, was the final day the rental would be covered and that any claims for bodily injury or lost wages needed to be directed to our bodily injury team partners.

We followed up on the signed final release via email on March 12, 2025, and again on March 18, 2025.

We have consistently advised that we are only handling the claim for the damage to the vehicle and will not be settling any injury claims or loss of wages. While we understand you did not have insurance at the time of the accident, and we are managing the vehicle damage claim directly, we have clearly communicated on multiple occasions that the rental beyond February 10, 2025, would not be covered by us and that any other costs need to be addressed with Sid. 

Once we receive the signed final release for the vehicle damage, we will initiate the payment process for the $18,619.28 settlement of the vehicle. Please also submit the rental invoices for possible reimbursement.

Regarding your recent emails mentioning potential legal action, we will always advise you to Govern Yourself Accordingly.

 

Thank you

Dear TD Insurance,

 

Following my previous correspondence and the recent reply from the Senior Customer Complaints Office (SCCO) dated April 25, 2025, I am now formally requesting that TD Insurance provide a written response from a Senior Manager regarding the unresolved property damage portion of my claim (#041518966).

 

Per SCCO’s process, no further review can take place until this is completed by your team.

 

Specific Request: Reimbursement of Rental Costs

 

I am seeking reimbursement for vehicle rental expenses incurred between January 12 and April 24, 2025 — a total of 103 days at $50/day, amounting to $5,150.00, plus $260.79 in accrued interest:

 

Description

Amount (CAD)

Rental Vehicle (103 days @ $50)

$5,150.00

Accrued Interest

$260.79

Total

$5,410.79

 

Next Steps

I am requesting a formal written response from a Senior Manager clarifying:

 

Whether TD Insurance will reimburse this amount; and

 

If not, a detailed rationale and policy reference explaining the refusal.

 

Additionally, I respectfully request that any further discussion not involve Mr. Tom Hanlon or Mr. Mohammed Sagor, as prior efforts with them have not resulted in resolution.

 

If I do not receive a written response within 5 business days, I will proceed with escalation to the Alberta Small Claims Court.

 

Thank you,

Wade Thesen

Formal Escalation – Unresolved Claim #041518966.msg,<wade.thesen@yahoo.com>,"""'Account; TD SCCO'"" <TD.SCCO@td.com>",,Formal Escalation – Unresolved Claim #041518966,2025-04-30 10:55:15.832181-06:00,"Dear Senior Customer Complaints Office,

 

I am writing to formally escalate my complaint regarding TD Insurance claim #041518966, which remains unresolved despite multiple good faith proposals and follow-ups.

 

Since April 25, 2025, I have submitted several formal proposals to TD Insurance in a clear attempt to resolve the matter amicably. Each proposal has gone largely unanswered or has been dismissed without proper consideration, despite my ongoing efforts to negotiate reasonably.

 

Summary of Unresolved Issues:

Unpaid Rental Costs:

I have incurred rental vehicle expenses totaling $5,450 from January 12 to April 28, 2025, due to delays in processing the claim. TD Insurance has unilaterally limited reimbursement to February 28, 2025, without acknowledging the impact of these delays on my continued rental needs.

 

Lack of Injury Claims Coordination:

Despite repeated requests since January, I have received no substantive contact from your Bodily Injury department. I was not provided contact information for the injury adjuster until April 2025, well after numerous emails and voicemails. It is not my responsibility to track down internal TD departments.

 

Slow and Inconsistent Communication:

Emails frequently went unanswered for 1.5 weeks or longer, significantly prolonging the resolution. Incomplete or inaccurate release forms have also contributed to delay.

 

Good Faith Proposals Ignored:

Since April 25, I have provided clear, itemized proposals outlining fair settlement terms, including a compromise date of March 31, 2025, as the final good faith rental reimbursement date. These proposals were intended to avoid litigation.

 

Requested Action:

*	I now respectfully request that the SCCO:

 

*	Review the file, including my email history, proposals, and supporting documents;

 

*	Provide a written explanation of how TD Insurance’s position aligns with industry standards and consumer rights for third-party claimants;

 

*	Confirm whether this matter will be fairly resolved or if I must proceed with action in Alberta Small Claims Court.

I remain open to resolution but cannot allow further delay without escalation. I look forward to your timely response.

PAY MAPPING AND BYPASS PAY IDENTIFICATION GUIDE
============================================

1. DEFINE PAY CRITERIA
-------------------
- Use the pay_cutoffs.csv file to define cutoffs for each formation
- Typical cutoffs:
  * VSH < 0.4 (cleaner reservoir)
  * PHIE > 0.08 (sufficient porosity)
  * SW < 0.6 (hydrocarbon presence)
  * K > 1-10 mD (formation-dependent)

2. FLAG PAY ZONES
---------------
- Calculate flag curves in your log analysis workflow
- Generate summations of net pay for each well/zone
- Populate the pay_analysis_template.csv with real data

3. IDENTIFY BYPASS PAY
--------------------
- Compare identified pay intervals with perforation history
- Flag unperforated pay intervals
- Calculate potential hydrocarbon volumes
- Rank opportunities based on quality and thickness

4. CREATE PAY MAPS
-----------------
- Use the pay_mapping_data.csv template for data organization
- Import to mapping software (Petrel, Techlog Maps, etc.)
- Generate contour maps for:
  * Net Pay Thickness
  * Average Porosity
  * Hydrocarbon Pore Volume
  * Recoverable Reserves
- Identify sweet spots and bypass opportunities
